I've brushed up against the tradwife trend, seen it in the periphery of my reading and internet browsing. It always seemed utterly ridiculous to watch people perform chores or cook for an audience -- it's not the kind of fantasy content that I go for.

There was also a period when we lived in the Annex in Toronto, surrounded by stately Victorian multi-million dollar homes and I spent so much time trying to fight off yearning for a larger place to live, something bigger than our 1 bedroom apartment, 3 cats, clutter and one toddler with all the accoutrements that I learned to stay away from fantasies that will cause me pain. My Buddhist teachers advise being aware of what you're feeling in the moment so that you can learn which thoughts and actions lead to greater joy and peace and then move away from that which brings pain.

At the same time, I can see the appeal of the fantasy -- letting someone else shoulder the burden of earning the money, leaving me free to concern myself with how I look, how the house looks, what's for dinner and how the children are doing. I mean, I've had my forays into baking sourdough from my own starter, cooking with farm fresh eggs I got from a student's family's hobby farm, making protein balls at home that my kids can take in their lunches; I've spent more time studying children's mental health and development than the average parent because of the profile of my family, I've homeschooled my older child and given birth at home. I've also worked full time and developed a career in one traditionally female field where I was very good at what I did.

But I burned out. Hard.

Over the last 6 years I've gotten to know myself much better, realized that as strong as I am, my strength has limits and while the limit is flexible at any given moment, if it's disrespected for a prolonged period of time, if I keep pushing myself to keep going out of sheer conviction that I can do it, once I stop and admit I'm tired, done, broken, fed up, it's so much harder to recover.

Rare is the person who can "do it all" - work full time on someone else's schedule, raise children, keep a house, maintain friendships and a relationship with their partner and family. I'm not that person.

When I'm working full time, I give a lot at work, probably more than I should, but I don't know how to hold back when other people's children are placed in my care and I'm given the responsibility to ensure they are well and learning. It's hard to turn my mind off. I'm thinking about students' relationships to each other, to me, to the work we're doing together, planning activities, giving detailed feedback to them on the work they've done, bringing resources and planning activities while also fighting my anxiety about failing the Board's expectations of me, not having enough marks for report cards because I actually hate marking with a passion. All this internal work, combined with the external work of interacting with masses of people all day drains my batteries so much that I want to be a hermit at the end of the day. Don't talk to me. 

This is the "Work hard" part of that old saw, but that leaves no more energy for anything else.

When my first son was born, I found a groove in which I could be a happy parent. It just took a while. My background anxiety that I had learned to live with all my life amped up after he was born and it took a while for the hypervigilance of the first year of his life to calm down. But I never ended up back on the same low-grade level, I was a lot more likely to get thrown out of equilibrium, especially by child related challenges. My kids are really great at showing me where my blind spots are, where I still need to work on myself. 

When my second son was born, it was pure joy incarnate. There's a photo of me lying back with a newborn on my chest and my face is lit with a radiant smile. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Six months after that photo I was hoping I could "disappear completely, and never be found." (Radiohead, Kid A) The isolation of mat leave in a suburban town where I knew no one, coupled with my older son's increasing intransigence and my partner working nights combined together into the start of parental burnout from which I'm still recovering.

Why move to the burbs? We wanted to own a house. Why have another child? We wanted more people to love. Why work nights? Because mat leave doesn't pay enough to support the family.

Since then, I've become a better parent, learned more about where my parenting and teaching styles came from and discovered that I can't light myself on fire for work and home and expect to remain a functional human being. I learned to ask for help, in fact to yell for help, until I got it. 

I also discovered I actually don't belong in the category of "woman," despite biological evidence. There was always discomfort with typically feminine behaviours, interests and attitudes; other women seem to know or have a certain something that I lacked and people could sense it about me. 

These days I identify as a hothouse flower still figuring out what type of care it needs to thrive and flourish. 

Tradwives can have it -- the cooking, cleaning, making themselves look pretty for their man, birthing innumerable children. I'd rather have someone take care of that for me while I go out into the world and solve problems, work with people who want to hear what I have to say. I'd like to be a part of a larger family where I'm not the only source of fulfillment for my family members -- I've never felt like I can meet everyone's needs or live with being unable to meet their needs. 

Feminism has had an interesting run in North America. My mother the engineer was flabbergasted that she was considered a "woman in a non-traditional profession" when she came here and that her colleagues were not used to working with a woman of her technical acumen. I was fortunate to be raised in a patriarchal country where no one in my family considered me "less than" just because I was born a girl. Men in my culture usually want sons, my dad was happy to have a daughter. Both sets of my grandparents were encouraging of me. No one expected me to marry and bear children, quite the opposite so maybe I am a product of my upbringing.

Yes, women are just as capable as men, that needs no more proving from my perspective, but that's beside the point when we live and work in a system that will squeeze every last drop of energy from us for less and less benefit. We're sold dreams of "single family homes," yet property  is more and more expensive to buy. We're sold dreams of various possessions that will make life simpler, easier or more fun, yet products are of lower and lower quality, more complex and harder to repair and planned to become obsolete. Acceptance, patience and harmony have gone out the window in favour of maximum benefit to one's Self.

At the end of our lives possessions won't matter, status, fame, identity. None. What will we all have left in those last days? Ethics and virtues we practiced.

So good luck to all tradwives and those who follow them, good luck to all of us who are making decisions today that we hope we'll be content with later on. Let's hope it matters when it counts.
